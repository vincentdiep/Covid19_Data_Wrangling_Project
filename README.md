# Covid19_Data_Wrangling_Project
Project involving the use of R to clean up and organize data to find strong correlations between covid19 deaths and other variables.
Tables were cleaned up using the R programming language and the tidyverse package.

The goal of this project is to use linear modeling to quantify some of the variation in mortality from Covid-19 in different countries due to differences in age demographics and hospital instructure.
